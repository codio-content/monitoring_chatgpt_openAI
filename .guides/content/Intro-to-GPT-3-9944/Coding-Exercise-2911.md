In this exercise, we'll be writing a function `Generate` which uses OpenAI's API to generate text. This function will take a list of prompts from the user, process each prompt with the OpenAI model, and return the response generated by each prompt, as well as the time it took to generate each response.

Here's how the Generate function works:

- The function accepts a list of prompts as its parameter.
- For each prompt, we record the start time and then use `openai.Completion.create` to generate a response from OpenAI. We limit the response to 100 tokens, but you can adjust this limit based on your needs.
- We then record the end time and calculate the time taken for the generation.
- We store the response text and the time taken in a tuple, and append this tuple to our list of responses.
- Finally, we return the list of responses.

You can call this function with a list of prompts like this:
```python
prompts = ["Who won the world series in 2020?", "What's the capital of France?", "Who wrote Pride and Prejudice?"]
responses = Generate(prompts)

for i, (response, time_taken) in enumerate(responses):
    print(f"Prompt: {prompts[i]}\nResponse: {response}\nTime Taken: {time_taken} seconds\n")
```

{Try it!}(python3 exerc.py)


The response generated should look like the following: 

```text-hide-clipboard
Prompt: Who won the world series in 2020?
Response: The Los Angeles Dodgers won the 2020 World Series.
Time Taken: 0.42620301246643066 seconds

Prompt: What's the capital of France?
Response: Paris
Time Taken: 0.3195617198944092 seconds

Prompt: Who wrote Pride and Prejudice?
Response: Jane Austen
Time Taken: 0.39693474769592285 seconds
```
